hello!  
I am Liu Hongchi, a girl from the south.  
I enjoy drawing and writing. Sometimes I can be shy and other times lively, which creates a contrasting personality. I love cats, dogs, and cute things. I also enjoy anime and the world of two dimensions.   
If you share the same interests and hobbies as me, feel free to connect and communicate with me.
